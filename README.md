# IrisClassification

The Iris dataset consists of three species: Iris Setosa, Iris Versicolour, and Iris Virginica. 
There are 50 examples of each species for a total of 150 examples in the entire dataset. 
The feature vectors are 4-dim, consisting of the sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. 
One class of Iris is linearly separable; however, two classes are not linearly separable.
This algorithm takes a matrix of shape (150, 4) and utilize the Perceptron classifier to recognize each type of Iris species.
